        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hello! I'm Eziulo Austin Nnanna, from Ebonyi State, Nigeria. I'm currently a 200level student of Computer Science at Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu Alike Ikwo, Ebonyi State.<br>My tech journey into web development started when I got to see alot of people in school coding and programming.</p>
        <h3>The Spark</h3>
        <p>Back in 2023, when I got into the university, I got to see so many persons coding and programming with their laptops. I did not actually know what they were doing.<br>On a fateful day someone who do programming asked me, "What department are you in?", I answered him Computer Science and we talked for a little  while and I opened up to him that I will love to do coding and programming, he connected me with his friend that is into web development and we discussed. I was filled with joy that day after our discussion.</p>
        <h3>Learning Phase</h3>
        <p>I started learning couple of days after my discussion I call him my "Coding Tutor" we agreed to be learning every weekdays around 7pm till 9pm. My eagerness to learn coding and programming made me to be punctual and attentive to the class. My Coding Tutor taught me most of the things I needed to learn on HTML.</p>
        <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
        <p>During my course of learning coding and programming I encountered some challenges like: <ul>
          <li>I had no laptop then to practice after learning. During learning I did make use of his own.</li>
          <li>Some days after a stress day I still had to prepare to go for my classes. It was really exhausting.</li>
          <li>Months later, the classes were not that active again. It was because my Coding Tutor was in his final year, he had alot on his head as a final year student.</li>
        </ul> Those were the challenges I faced on my course of learning coding and programming.</p>
        <h3>Current Progress</h3>
        <p>Currently, I'm learning on my own using Youtube and Codeacademy resources. I just concluded on the HTML and CSS couple of weeks ago, I'm into JavaScript now. <br> Also, I'm taking an UpSkill course on web development with Genesys Tech Hub. I'm as well still receiving some tuition from my Coding Tutor.</p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        I have three (3) completed projects and two (2) projects I'm still working on using HTML and CSS there are respectively:
        <ol>
          <li>Portfolio website for my sewing brand <strong>Austin's Workspace</strong></li>
          <li>Contact Form with a form action that submits data received.</li>
          <li>Recreated my school's student portal <strong>Funai Portal</strong></li>
          <li>Portfolio website for my tech as a web developer</li>
          <li>Website narrating my tech journey as a web developer. Once you're able to see this it would then be counted as a completed project.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>As I continue on my web development journey, my goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack developer, capable of building powerful, user-friendly applications from start to finish. I aim to build digital tools that solve real-world problems, especially for small businesses and creatives like myself. Eventually, I hope to give back by mentoring beginners, contributing to open-source projects, and possibly launching my own tech product or service. This journey is far from over and I'm excited for what's ahead.</p>
